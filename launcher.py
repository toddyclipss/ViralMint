ViralMint Launcher — Toolbox for non-technical users.
Double-click to open. System tray icon + optional GUI window.

Features:
  - System tray with the real ViralMint icon + tri-state status
    (stopped / starting / running), breathing-pulse animation while
    the backend boots.
  - Tray menu: Start / Stop / Restart Service, Open WebUI, Copy URL,
    Show Launcher, Quit.
  - If tkinter available: a warm-themed launcher window with buttons.
  - Close window → minimizes to tray (service keeps running).
  - Quit from tray → confirms if jobs are running, then stops everything.
  - Crash watchdog auto-restarts an unexpectedly-dead backend (crash-loop
    guarded) and snapshots the log tail as a crash report.

This launcher ALWAYS auto-starts the backend on boot AND ALWAYS opens the
browser when the service becomes ready — there is no preferences file and
there are no toggles. Since this is the open-source SOURCE distribution,
the backend is launched by running `run.py` with the project's Python.

#   • Frozen (the packaged .app/.exe): launcher.py is the bundle entry point.
#     It re-invokes the bundled binary with `--run-backend` (Option C), which
#     runs uvicorn in a supervised child process. A standalone backend binary
#     (BACKEND_BIN) is still preferred if a two-stage packager produced one.
# In all modes the backend is a SEPARATE process so the tray watchdog can

# The launcher had a `~/ViralMint/launcher.json` preferences file with
# two boolean toggles ("auto_start", "auto_open") wired to tray-menu
# checkmarks. Both were removed — the launcher now always auto-starts the
# service on boot AND always opens the browser when the service becomes
# ready. The toggles created more confusion than value ("I checked it, why
# doesn't it open?" / "I unchecked it, why does it still open?") and the fix
# made them moot. A stray launcher.json in the data dir is harmless and
# ignored.
