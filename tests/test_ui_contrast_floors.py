"""Small text has to clear 4.5:1 — measured, not asserted as a hex.

Two colours in the app sat between the DECORATION floor (3:1) and the TEXT
floor (4.5:1), which is the band where a colour looks deliberate and is still
unreadable:

  - the brand terracotta that marks "Created" in the Library measures 3.44:1
    on the light canvas. Right for the provenance rail and the dot, too faint
    for the word at 10px uppercase.
  - a filled success chip is white on `success.main` (#16a34a) = 3.30:1, and a
    scout grid puts a column of them on one screen.

Pinning the ratio rather than the hex means a future palette tweak is free to
pick a different colour and is not free to make it unreadable.
