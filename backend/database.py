# A running/pending job whose heartbeat is younger than this is treated as

# handoff. uvicorn frees its listening socket at the START of graceful
# shutdown and then keeps finishing background work, so a replacement instance
# can boot while the old one is still running a job: "port free" never meant
# "process gone". Progress ticks refresh the heartbeat every few seconds (see
# ws_manager.send_progress), so 180s tolerates the occasional long silent step
# (Whisper on a big file) without leaving genuinely dead jobs stuck "running"
# for more than a couple of minutes.
ZOMBIE_GRACE_SECONDS = 180

# Job ids that were still non-terminal, with a FRESH heartbeat, when the boot
# sweep ran. The lifespan handoff watcher (backend/main.py) watches exactly this
# set. It deliberately does NOT re-query "everything running" later: by then this
# instance may have created jobs of its own, and a job with a long silent step
# (Whisper on a big file can exceed the grace period without a progress tick)
# would be failed while it is perfectly alive — the very bug this machinery
# exists to prevent. Mutated in place so `from … import` references stay valid.

    """Fail running/pending jobs whose heartbeat is STALE; leave fresh ones.

    Returns ``(swept_count, still_nonterminal_ids)``. A NULL heartbeat (rows
    written before the ``updated_at`` column existed) counts as stale — the same
    outcome those rows always got.

    ``only_ids`` scopes a pass to a known watch-set (the handoff watcher's boot
    snapshot) so jobs created by the CURRENT instance are never candidates.

    The write is a CONDITIONAL UPDATE, not a read-then-mutate. A plain ORM
    mutation is a lost update: if a draining predecessor commits "success"
    between our SELECT and our COMMIT, we would overwrite it with "failed" and it
    would never write again — producing exactly the failure-toast-for-a-
    completed-video bug in a narrower window.

    The staleness DECISION is made in Python from the parsed timestamp; the SQL
    guard is `status IN ('running','pending')` and nothing more. That is what
    closes the harmful race — a predecessor that COMPLETES between our SELECT and
    our UPDATE is no longer running/pending, so we match zero rows and leave its
    result intact.

    `updated_at` is deliberately absent from the WHERE. SQLite stores DATETIME as
    TEXT, so any comparison there silently depends on the stored separator:
    '2026-07-26T13:47:04' sorts ABOVE '2026-07-26 13:54:16' because 'T' > ' ',
    which made a genuinely 10-minute-stale row look fresh (caught live). An
    equality guard has the same flaw — SQLAlchemy re-binds the value with its own
    separator and matches nothing. The residual cost is that a progress tick
    landing inside the SELECT→UPDATE window (microseconds, on a job already
    silent for the whole grace period) does not spare the job; status is the
    guard that matters. Never raises.
