"""Library taxonomy — the ONE place a stored row is classified.

Every durable file you own answers two independent questions:

    media  = video | image | audio | doc     — what the file IS
    origin = created | edited | imported     — where it CAME FROM

Those axes are orthogonal, which is the whole point. The Library page used to
tab on a mix of the two (Scout / Downloaded / Generated is an origin axis), so
an item with a true answer on both — a downloaded mp3, a voice-over, audio
pulled out of your own video — had to be filed under one and was lost from the
other. Splitting them means every row lands in exactly one place per axis:

    downloaded mp3                     → audio · imported
    voice-over                         → audio · created
    a clip cut from a download         → video · edited    (parent = that download)

`PRODUCERS` maps the keys already stored on rows — `generated_videos.source_type`
and `jobs.job_type` — onto (label, media, origin). It is the single source for
that mapping: the Library index, the Library page and the API all resolve
through here rather than keeping their own lists.

**A file-writing job_type missing from this map is invisible in the Library.**
That is not a hypothetical — before this existed, every one of the twenty tools
wrote its output to disk and showed it on no surface at all. `tests/
test_library_taxonomy.py` fails the build when a tool endpoint creates a job
type this map doesn't cover.

The frontend mirror is `frontend/src/components/librarynext/assetModel.js` —
same keys, same labels, and a drift test compares the two literally, because
two hand-maintained copies of one map is how they end up disagreeing.
