"""Motion-graphics render — drives HyperFrames as an asyncio subprocess.

Materializes a composition from a bundled template + JSON variables, invokes
`node cli.js render … --variables …`, validates the MP4 with ffprobe, and
returns its Path. Everything here is local: headless Chrome draws the frames and
FFmpeg encodes them, so a motion piece costs nothing per render and needs no
network once the plugin is installed.

Two entry points:
  - render()          — a BUNDLED template (motion_assets/templates/<id>) with
                        variables injected. Used by the install smoke-render and
                        the Settings "test render" button.
  - render_project()  — an already-staged project directory (index.html +
                        assets/), for compositions authored elsewhere.
