"""Job-table retention — keep the log bounded without deleting the library.

The `jobs` table is append-only in practice: every scout, download, analyze,
render and tool run adds a row and nothing ever removed them. On the author's dev
install it reached 2,260 rows (1,407 of them failures) in three months, and the
Activity panel reads it, so both the DB and that panel grow without limit.

⚠️ **THE TRAP.** A successful tool job IS a library item. `library_index` projects
`jobs.output_json.file` into the Library, and the asset endpoint resolves a file
by job id. Deleting an old `tool:captions` row would make the captioned video
vanish from every surface while the bytes sat on disk forever — a data-loss bug dressed as
housekeeping. So retention is defined by what a row IS, not by how old it is:

    prunable   = terminal status AND older than the window AND not a library item
    kept       = anything running/pending, and every row backing a file that
                 still exists on disk, at any age

That makes the sweep safe by construction: the only rows it can remove are
records of ACTIVITY (a scout that ran, a download that failed, an analyze that
completed) plus rows whose file is already gone, which the index skips anyway.

A hard ceiling backs the time window, because a heavy week can add thousands of
rows inside the retention period; it deletes the oldest prunable rows only, and
never touches the library either.
