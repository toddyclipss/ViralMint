    The watch-set is the boot sweep's OWN output (database.BOOT_FRESH_JOB_IDS),

    the time this coroutine first runs, the server may already be serving, so a

    silent step (Whisper on a big file can outlast the grace period without a
    progress tick) would then be failed while perfectly alive, which is the exact
    bug this machinery exists to prevent.

    Each pass re-checks that set and fails any job that went stale (predecessor
    exited mid-job). Exits once every watched job is terminal or swept.

    Replaces the old _cleanup_orphaned_jobs, which was dead code (init_db's sweep
    always ran first and left it nothing to do) and, worse in spirit, assumed any
