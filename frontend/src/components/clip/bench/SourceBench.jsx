/* ── The cutting bench ─────────────────────────────────────────
   What used to be an empty panel when you selected a source video.

   There are no modes here. The bench holds ONE list of pending cuts, and
   four things put a cut into it — all producing the same editable block:

     drag on the filmstrip · N (or +) at the playhead · paste timestamps ·
     Ask AI

   Ask AI is the one worth explaining. It PROPOSES (POST /suggest-clips,
   which cuts nothing) and its picks arrive as ordinary blocks you can drag,
   retime or delete. That is the point of routing the model through here
   rather than leaving it in the modal: the AI's choice of in/out point used
   to be final and invisible until the clips already existed, and now it is a
   starting position on a timeline.

   It was briefly a "My ranges | AI picks" toggle in the header. Once the
   pending cuts moved to the rail that stopped being true — "My ranges"
   rendered nothing, and the strip stayed draggable either way, because
   dragging was never what the toggle controlled. A control that says
   "you are in AI mode now" over a surface with no modes is a lie about
   the product, so it is a button.

   Nothing on this surface produces a file. The one act that does is the Cut
   button, and it cuts exactly the blocks that are on screen. The hero's
   Auto-cut is the other door: same model, but it cuts immediately, with no
   review and no cap.
